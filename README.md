# Hsuan-DataScience(UCI)
The school asked us to make a report of data analysis, but I developed it into a cpmplete data science project.

###At the beginning, we can refer to Data Science project.pdf to understand the entire project.
https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/Data%20Science%20project.pdf
  We use Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process to complete this project.
  Regarding Data Understanding, we use python code and data visualization to understand the data.
  In the part of Data Preprocessing, we use several methods(like standardize the data, use cross-validation, use SMOTE), each of which has its own trained model.
  In the Modeling section, we use several algorithms(Support Vector Machine, KNeighbors, DecisionTree, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, Neural network, etc.).
  Evaluation has different evaluation methods for classification models and regression models. The evaluation values are put together into a table for comparison.
  Deployment can be divided into two parts, one is data visualization to show the model results, the other one is to apply the results for practical application.

Next, we can view all the code in the following files
  File one has all the code (and notes), and the data has not undergone any pre-processing.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/1.No_DataPreprocessing.pdf
  File two is to process the data that does not meet the normal distribution, and we will normalize the data by Z-Score.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/2.Standardlized.pdf
  File three is that using cross-validation to reduce the chance of overfitting.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/3.Kfold.pdf
  File four is to use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to solve the problem of unbalanced data.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/4.SMOTE.pdf
  File five combined data standardization with cross-validation.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/5.standardlized%26kfold.pdf
  File six combined data standardization with SMOTE.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/6.standardlized%26SMOTE.pdf
  File seven combined cross-validation with SMOTE.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/7.kfold%26SMOTE.pdf
  File eight combined data standardization with cross-validation and SMOTE.
    https://github.com/HSUAN110/Hsuan-DataScience-UCI/blob/main/8.standardlized%26kfold%26SMOTE.pdf
I organize the code into PDF files that is easy to read!If you need the code as .py files, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.
